# Ask me anything!

Hello There!

Thanks a lot for getting in touch with me! This is my [AMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#IAmA_and_AMA).

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!
Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## Other ways to reachout to me:

### Is email OK?:

Yes, its fine. But GitHub is the fastest way to reachout to me. With the amount of spam these days, its easy to miss an important email such as yours :neutral_face:!

If you prefer email, do not hesitate to drop your query `ama[at]raisedadead[dot]com`. I will post them here for you (redacting as much details as I can erring as a human).

### How about Twitter?

Yes, why not? My DMs are open. Give me a follow :wink:. I tweet (and retweet fun stuff).
