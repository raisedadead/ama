# Ask me anything!

Hello there! 👋

Thanks a lot for getting in touch with me! This is my [AMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#IAmA_and_AMA).

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!
Anything means _anything_. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## Other ways to connect:

### Do you do Emails?

Absolutely, but please be patient. I do get a ton of emails, notifications & alerts. With the amount of spam these days, its easy to miss an important email such as yours! 🤷🏽‍♂️

**GitHub is the fastest way to reachout**. [Consider a public ama](https://github.com/raisedadead/ama/issues/new), if your query does not warrant email. 

Note: Pitching me a service, product or similar for my employer will be ignored straight up, so don't bother.

Email me here: `ama [at] raisedadead .com` | `mrugesh [@] freecodecamp.org`, I will try and post some of the queries here redacting as much as I can for benefit of others.

### How about Twitter?

Yes, why not? My DMs are open. Give me a follow 😉. I tweet (and retweet fun stuff).
